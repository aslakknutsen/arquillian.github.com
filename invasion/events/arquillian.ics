DESCRIPTION:\n					<p>2000 called\, it wants its bloatware back. At JBoss
 \, we decided to flip the switch and make enterprise Java development pr
 oductive.</p>\n<p>This keynote presents a new vision for Java EE applica
 tions--one that&#39\;s slim\, fast and powerful. We&#39\;ll talk about h
 ow you kick off your project with JBoss Forge and JBoss Tools\, how the 
 Web Profile provides both power and convenience\, why writing real tests
  using Arquillian matters\, reintroduce you application server that chan
 ged it all\, again\, then take it to the cloud\, and for a stroll on our
  mobile device!</p>\n<p>It&#39\;s gonna be fast! It&#39\;s gonna be fun!
  It&#39\;s gonna be open! That&#39\;s the reputation we want for Java EE
 . That&#39\;s the productivity we want to give you.</p>\n

DESCRIPTION:\n					<p>Are you confident enough to push your application t
 o production right now? Will it deploy? Integrate all the components? Ke
 ep the fail whale at bay? Confidence comes from tests. Real tests.</p>\n
 <p>Discover how to use Arquillian to develop tests that execute inside a
  container and gain confidence that keeps you developing\, knowing your 
 application will stand up to the real world.</p>\n<p>In the workshop\, w
 e&#39\;ll cover:</p>\n<ul class="bullets">\n  <li>Why integration tests 
 are important</li>\n  <li>What plagues integration tests today</li>\n  <
 li>Why testing inside a container makes a test real</li>\n  <li>How to w
 rite your first Arquillian test</li>\n  <li>How to test a myriad of Java
  EE technologies using Arquillian</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether youâ€™re learn
 ing a new technology\, debugging or laying down new code\, Arquillian pr
 ovides the test platform you need to keep development continuous.</p>\n
